\* *Created for an assignment for Design and Analysis of Software Systems, IIITH, Spring 2022* \*

Run the game by running `main2.py`, and replay by running `repay2.py`.
Note that the notion of time in the game is user controlled, i.e. each moment stays frozen until you make your next move.

Some general notes about the running of the game:
- Walls are brown, town hall (middle of the map) is light blue, wizard towers are purple, cannons are grey, huts are lavender.
- Hero (king/queen) is red, barbarians are black, archers are pink, balloons are blue.
- Troops get paler as they lose health, builings get darker.
- Use a,s,d,f to move king, queen around.
- Use space for king and queen's normal attacks, and x for the special one.
- Use e to trigger heal spell, r for rage spell.
- c, v, b spawn barbarians (upto 6) from bottom left, middle, right respectively.
- f, g, h spawn archers (upto 6) from the same tiles.
- t, y, u spawn balloons (upto 3), also from the same tiles.

Most of the in-game functionality and dynamics will play out as described in the two Assignment PDFs, so refer to those for the rest of the gameplay.
